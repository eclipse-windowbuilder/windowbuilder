/**
 * Implementations of {@link IEditPartConfigurator} are used by {@link EditPartFactory} to configure
 * any created {@link EditPart}.
 * <p>
 * Now {@link IEditPartConfigurator}'s are used to add some {@link EditPolicy} on {@link EditPart},
 * even if {@link EditPart} itself does not know anything about these {@link EditPolicy}.
 * <p>
 * For example we have SWT and <code>ControlEditPart</code>, that is used in both RCP and eRCP. But
 * in eRCP there is <code>Command</code> that can be dropped on <code>Control</code>. However we can
 * not install corresponding {@link EditPolicy} in <code>ControlEditPart</code> because at "shared"
 * SWT level we don't know anything about eRCP and <code>Command</code>.
