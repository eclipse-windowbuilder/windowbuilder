	<exception id="0" title="Wrapper">This is a wrapper exception for other exceptions. In general, you should
		not see it. If you see it, this means that there is a bug in our exception displaying code. :-) </exception>
	<exception id="1" title="Internal Error">{product_name} encountered unexpected internal error.
		<p>This could be caused by a {product_name} bug or by a misconfiguration issue, conflict, partial 
		update, etc.</p>
	</exception>
	<exception id="2" title="Incomplete product installation">Incomplete product installation or upgrade
		detected. Please install or update the entire product. If the problem persists, un-install and
		re-install the entire product. Also ensure that the Eclipse JDT and PDE are fully installed as
		required by the system requirements.</exception>
	<exception id="99" title="Future exception">Congratulations! You found a case that we know about, however
		have not implemented support for it yet. Please report to support what you did and why this is

	<!-- Parser -->
	<!-- ======================================================== -->
	<exception id="100" title="No root methods">The parser can't find any root method(s) (entry points for
		parsing). The parser starts parsing from known method(s) for each GUI toolkit. For example, for Swing
		it starts from the constructor of a JPanel or JFrame. If the currently parsed class is not a subclass
		of a Swing component, the parser will try to find a main(java.lang.String[]) method. If it also does
		not exist, this exception will be shown. Usually this means that you are trying to parse something not
		supported by {product_name} (for example, a non-GUI compilation unit). <p> Note that even if
			{product_name} can't recognize your code pattern automatically, sometimes you can still teach
			{product_name} to work with it by providing a <code>@wbp.parser.entryPoint</code> JavaDoc hint.
			For example:</p>
		<pre>
	public class MyClass {
		/**
		 * <b>@wbp.parser.entryPoint</b>

		public void someNonStandardEntryPoint() {
			JFrame frame = new JFrame();
			...;

	<exception id="103" title="Unknown GUI toolkit">The parser parsed the compilation unit, but can't identify
		any GUI toolkit, so {product_name} can't display any GUI to edit. This can be caused by one of the
		following reasons: <ul>
			<li>This class is not an editable UI class and contains no UI components.</li>
			<li>{product_name} does not recognize the GUI toolkit or library used in this class.</li>
			<li>{product_name} does not understand this GUI type/pattern in a supported GUI toolkit.</li>
			<li>Problems exist with the classpath. For example, the compilation unit uses SWT classes, but the
				SWT/JFace libraries are not included into the classpath.</li>

	<exception id="300" title="Unknown expression">The AST evaluation engine was unable to evaluate the

			Depending on the context where these parameters are used, they can: <ul>

				<li>cause a parsing exception, for example, when a parameter is required to create a component
					instance - "new JButton(unknownParameter)"</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>You can use the <b>"@wbp.eval.method.parameter {parameter name} {Java expression}"</b> JavaDoc tag
			to force the value of the parameter, so your code will be evaluated even if the method is not
			invoked.</p>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<pre>
    public class MyPanel extends JPanel {

		<p>Note that you can use any valid Java expressions, including operators, invocations of static

	<exception id="312" title="Expression part of invocation is null.">Expression part of invocation
		<b>{0}</b> was evaluated into <b>null</b>. Possible reasons and solutions: <ul>
			<li>You use some object that really evaluates to <b>null</b> at design time, for example not
				initialized singletons, no required environment, etc.</li>
			<li>Evaluation of expression at the end requires some parameter passed into constructor. By
				default {product_name} gives all parameters default value (false, zero or null). You can use
				JavaDoc tag on constructor <b>@wbp.eval.method.parameter obj new SomeObject()</b> to set
				better value. See documentation for details.</li>

		However, if you have more than one constructor, the parser can't decide which to use, so you should
		help it by adding a <b>@wbp.parser.constructor</b> JavaDoc tag to the constructor that should be used
