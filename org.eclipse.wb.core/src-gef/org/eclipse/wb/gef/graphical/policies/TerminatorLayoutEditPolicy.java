/**
 * Special {@link LayoutEditPolicy} that accepts any object, but returns <code>null</code> as
 * {@link Command}.
 * <p>
 * Separate {@link LayoutEditPolicy} for different types of objects is good, because we can filter
 * objects in one place, instead of each <code>getXXXCommand()</code>. But if {@link Request} was
 * not handled by {@link EditPart} at all, this {@link EditPart} will become "transparent", so this
 * will for example look like we drop new object on parent {@link EditPart}. This is not good in
 * most cases.
