					<h2>Requesting Technical Support</h2>
			<p>The 
			quickest mechanism for requesting support is to use the <b>
			<a href="../error_reporting.html">Error Reporting</a></b> 
			system included within the product. Just click the <b>Create Report</b> button and 
			submit the case to the <strong>
<a href="http://eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=thread&amp;frm_id=214">
WindowBuilder forum</a></strong> or bug tracking system (<strong><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/">Bugzilla 
&gt; Tools &gt; WindowBuilder</a></strong>)..</p>
					<p>If you are unable to use the <b>
					<a href="../error_reporting.html">Error Reporting</a></b> 
			system, please include our <a href="#support-form">support form</a> with the 
			product name, version and platform with any forum 
			support requests. In addition, please be sure to provide the details 
			on your operating system and/or development environment. Your 
			questions should be concise and restricted to a single incident or 
			request. If you have any <a href="test_cases.html">code</a> which may be relevant to the problem 
			please include it. Example <a href="test_cases.html">code</a> that illustrates the problem is 
			especially welcome (and often leads to a quicker resolution) as are 
			debug logs generated in the event of a system exception.</p>
			<a id="bug-found" name="bug-found"></a>
			<h2>What if I think I've found a bug?</h2>
			<p>We appreciate the help of our users in identifying 
			bugs in our software. Bugs are an inconvenience to all of us, but 
			unfortunately the reality of software development. We accept bug 
			reports, using the form below, via email, fax or phone. If an 
			exception occurs within the product, you may also use the
			<a href="../error_reporting.html">error reporting</a> 
			option.</p>
			<a id="support-form" name="support-form"></a>
