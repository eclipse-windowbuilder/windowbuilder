= Layout Managers

A program written in Java may be deployed on multiple platforms. If you
were to use standard UI design techniques, specifying absolute positions
and sizes for your UI components, your UI won't be portable. What looks
fine on your development system might be unusable on another platform.
To solve this problem, Java provides a system of portable layout
managers. You use these layout managers to specify rules and constraints
for the layout of your UI in a way that will be portable.

Layout managers can provide the following advantages:

* Correctly positioned components that are independent of fonts, screen
resolutions, and platform differences.
* Intelligent component placement for containers that are dynamically
resized at runtime.
* Ease of translation. If a string increases in length after
translation, the associated components stay properly aligned.

== About layout managers

When writing Java applications, you may need to use layouts to give your
windows a specific look. A layout controls the position and size of
children in a container. Layout classes are subclasses of the abstract
class Layout. Both SWT and Swing provide several standard layout
classes, and you can write custom layout classes. Other UI toolkits
embed implicit layout managers in each panel type.

In Java, positioning and sizing does not happen automatically.
Applications can decide to size and place a container's children
initially, or in a resize listener. Another option is to specify a
layout class to position and size the children. If children are not
given a size, they will have zero size and they cannot be seen.

The layout manager sets the sizes and locations of the components based
on various factors such as:

* The layout manager's layout rules.
* The layout manager's property settings, if any.
* The layout datas associated with each component.
* The size of the container.

Each layout manager has characteristic strengths and drawbacks.
Grid-based layouts and constraint-based layouts are the most useful and
powerful of the standard layouts, but they are also the most
complicated. When using the design view, you can change the layout
whenever you like. The tool adjusts the code as needed on the fly.
Change the layout either by explicitly adding a layout manager to the
source code for the container, or by selecting a layout for the
composite on the design surface.
