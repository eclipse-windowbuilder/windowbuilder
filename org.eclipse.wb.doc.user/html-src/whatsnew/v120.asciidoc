= What's New - v1.20.0

== General

The property table has been overhauled to avoid jumps after editing a property
and to hide the tool-tip again when the mouse wheel is scrolled. Additionally,
the SWT-based buttons have been replaced by pure GEF-based buttons to allow for
a better integration into the table.
