= What's New - v1.20.0

== General

The property table has been overhauled to avoid jumps after editing a property
and to hide the tool-tip again when the mouse wheel is scrolled. Additionally,
the SWT-based buttons have been replaced by pure GEF-based buttons to allow for
a better integration into the table.

Palette contributions may now also use SVGs as icons. If both an SVG and a PNG
exist, the SVG file takes precedence if and only if SVGs are supported by the
current Eclipse version.

- Added conversion support for `java.awt.Cursor`, `java.awt.Font` and `java.awt.ComponentOrientation` in the Customizer.
