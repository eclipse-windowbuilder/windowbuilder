= What's New - v1.21.0

== Swing

- Improved HighDPI support for Swing components

Previously, the preview for Swing components was taken at 100% zoom and then
artificially upscaled to the current display zoom, leading to blurry results in
the designer. Components are now directly captured with the correct zoom level.
