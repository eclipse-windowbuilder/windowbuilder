- Deprecated support for Applet/JApplet

The Applet API has been deprecated for removal with Java 9 and formally been
removed with Java 26. Support for those containers will be removed after the
2027-12 release.

When opening a JApplet with the editor, the root element will be annotated
with _<Deprecated>_
