- Deprecated support for Applet/JApplet

The Applet API has been deprecated for removal with Java 9 and formally been
removed with Java 26. Support for those containers will be removed after the
2027-12 release.

When opening a JApplet with the editor, the root element will be annotated
with _<Deprecated>_

When trying to create a new JApplet with the editor, the entry in the "New"
wizard and the dialog tile will be annotated with _(Deprecated)_

- New error code 1003 if multiple layouts are added to a container

This aligns the behavior of the Swing designer with the behavior of the SWT
designer. Adding multiple layouts to a composite is generally not supported
and causes issues when working with e.g. the GridLayout.

The parser now detects such cases and throws an appropriate error message.
