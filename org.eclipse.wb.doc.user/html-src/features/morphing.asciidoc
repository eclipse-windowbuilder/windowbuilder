a| It can be frustrating to suddenly want a *Group* instead of a *Composite*
or a *Combobox* rather than a *List* after you have already completed the
design of the composite. It is very easy to remedy this using the tool.

The editor allows you to morph similar components from one type to
another. When a component is morphed from one type to another, the
properties that are the same between the two types are kept. This allows
quick design changes without having to recreate all the components.

To morph a component from one type to another,
link:../userinterface/context_menu.html[right-click] on the component
and select a component type to morph to from the *Morph* cascading menu.

In addition to morphing to common sibling types, you can also morph a
component into any subclass or into any other arbitrary component type.
