= Factories

The tool supports the creation of custom factory classes and methods.
This is a convenient way to create customized, reusable versions of
common components. The tool supports the following features:

* xref:#Creating[Create a static factory method from any widget]
* xref:#Parameterizing[Factory methods may be parameterized with one or
more arguments]
* xref:#Applying[Morph any widget into a factory instance]
* xref:#AddingToPalette[Add any factory component to the palette]

The following is an example of a simple button that is converted into
multiple factories. The button has two properties set: its text is set
to "OK" and its color is set to red.

[cols="a,a"]
|===

| images/create_factory_menu.png[]

`JButton okButton = new JButton("OK");` +
`okButton.setForeground(Color.RED);`

[#Creating]
== Creating a factory method

Right-click on the component and select the *Factory > Create
factory...* command. In the *Create Factory* dialog, enter the name of
the factory class (or select an existing factory using the *Browse*
button) and the method name for the (static) factory method. If you wish
the new factory to be added to the
*xref:../userinterface/palette.adoc[Palette]*, select a palette category
or create a new category using the
*xref:../userinterface/palette_manager.adoc[Palette Manager]*.

Below this, you will see a list if *Creation arguments* and
*Invocations*. *Creation arguments* are passed directly to the
constructor of the widget while *Invocations* are applied to the widget
after creation. Note that for SWT factories, the *parent* container must
be passed as an argument as shown below on the right (*parent* cannot be
unchecked).

[#Parameterizing]
== Parameterizing a factory method

As shown in the SWT example above and in the two examples below, a check
in a leaf node within the tree indicates that a particular attribute
should be a parameterized argument of the factory method. Checking the
*text* creation argument will cause the *text* property to be passed
into the method and applied to the widget. Likewise, checking the
*foreground* invocation property will cause the *foreground* property to
be passed into the method and applied to the widget.

[cols="a,a"]
|===
| images/create_factory_dialog3.png[]
| images/create_factory_dialog4.png[]
|===

If an invocation property should be ignored entirely, uncheck it in the
*Invocations* list as shown below.

image:images/create_factory_dialog5.png[image]

Clicking *Create* or *OK*, will create the factory class, if necessary,
and add the factory method to it. Click *Create* to create multiple
related methods at one time; click *OK* to create a single method and
close the dialog.

Each factory method will be tagged with a *@wbp.factory* Javadoc tag.
The tool uses that tag to identify factory methods in a factory class.
If you create any factory methods by hand, you should add this same tag
in order to identify it to the editor. Any arguments passed into the
method should be identified with an *@wbp.factory.parameter.source*
Javadoc tag. That tag should also include the name of the parameter and
a suitable default value (used for initial code generation).

[source,java]
----
import javax.swing.JButton;
import java.awt.Color;

public final class MyFactory {
  /**
   * @wbp.factory
   */
  public static JButton createRedOkButton() {
    JButton button = new JButton("OK");
    button.setForeground(Color.RED);
    return button;
  }

  /**
   * @wbp.factory
   * @wbp.factory.parameter.source text "OK"
   */
   public static JButton createRedButton(String text) {
    JButton button = new JButton(text);
    button.setForeground(Color.RED);
    return button;
  }

  /**
   * @wbp.factory
   * @wbp.factory.parameter.source foreground java.awt.Color.RED
   */
  public static JButton createColoredOkButton(Color foreground) {
    JButton button = new JButton("OK");
    button.setForeground(foreground);
    return button;
  }

  /**
   * @wbp.factory
   */
  public static JButton createOkButton() {
    JButton button = new JButton("OK");
    return button;
  }
}
----

The original widget source will be also replaced with a call to the
newly created factory method.

`JButton okButton = MyFactory.createRedOkButton();`

[#Applying]
== Applying a factory to a widget

Once created, a factory may be applied to an existing widget using the
*Factory > Select Factory...* command. This is very similar to a
xref:morphing.adoc[morphing] operation. Once a factory has been
selected, its methods are shown directly in the *Factory* cascade menu
as shown below.

[#AddingToPalette]
== Adding factories to the palette

Factories may also be added to the palette for quick access using either
the *xref:../userinterface/palette_manager.adoc[Palette Manager]* or the
*xref:../userinterface/palette_context_menu.adoc[Palette context menu]*.

image:images/factory_custom_palette.png[image]

To add a single factory item, give it a name, select the factory class
and method signature, and give it a description. The component may be
initially *visible* or not and may be added to any available category.

image:../userinterface/images/add_static_factory_dialog2.png[image,width=463,height=278]

To add a multiple factory items at the same time, select the factory
class and method signatures. The component name and description will be
given default values. The components will be initially *visible* and may
be added to any available category.
