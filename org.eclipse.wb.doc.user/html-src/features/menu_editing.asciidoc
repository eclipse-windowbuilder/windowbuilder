Menus are a must for just about all GUIs. Using the editor, it
is quick and painless to create menu bars and popup menus.

To create a menu bar on your window, select *Menu Bar* (SWT) or
*JMenuBar* (Swing) from the
*link:../userinterface/palette.html[Palette]*, and then place it on your
window in the *link:../userinterface/design_view.html[Design View]*.

_Note that these instructions only apply to window types that support
menubars (e.g., SWT Shells, SWT Application Windows, and Swing JFrames).
They do not apply to window types that can't have menubars (e.g.,
Dialogs & Wizards) or that manage their own menubars through a special
framework (e.g., JFace ApplicationWindow)._

a| Each window can have at most one *Menu Bar*, and the only place that
you can put a *Menu Bar* is directly on a window. A particular menu will
only be displayed on the window on which it was created. After the *Menu Bar*
is placed, you should see a blank menu bar across the top of your window
in the *link:../userinterface/design_view.html[Design View]*.

a| To add individual menus to the menu bar, select *Cascade Menu Item*
(SWT) or *JMenu* (Swing) from the
*link:../userinterface/palette.html[Palette]*, and then place it on the
menu bar.

a| To add a menu item to a menu, select the dropdown menu and add a *Menu Item*
or *JMenuItem* to the dropdown menu that is displayed. If you want to make a
submenu, add a *Cascade Menu* or *JMenu* to the menu.

a| Menu items can also be a check or radio style. To create a checkbox or
radio button menu item, select *Check Menu Item* / *JCheckBoxMenuItem* or
*Radio Menu Item* / *JRadioButtonMenuItem* from the
*link:../userinterface/palette.html[Palette]* and add it to a menu.
Under SWT, *Check Menus Items* and *Radio Menu Items* are *Menu Items*
with their style set to *CHECK* or *RADIO*. To make a check or radio
menu item initially be selected, set the selection property to true in
the *link:../userinterface/property_pane.html[Property Pane]* for that
menu item.

a| You can also add an link:../userinterface/property_editor_image.html[image]
to a menu item. Simply select the menu item, click on the
link:../userinterface/property_editor_image.html[image] property in the
*link:../userinterface/property_pane.html[Property Pane]*, click on the
image:../userinterface/images/ellipses.png[image,width=16,height=16]
button in the property editor, and select an
link:../userinterface/property_editor_image.html[image].

a| Setting the text of a menu item is the same as setting the text of any
other control. In the *link:../userinterface/property_pane.html[Property
Pane]*, set the *text* property to the desired text. Under SWT, placing
an ampersand (&) before a letter in the *text* property will create a
mnemonic for that menu item. For Swing, you should set the *mnemonic*
property. On most platforms, the letter after the ampersand or the
character indicated by the *mnemonic* property will be underlined when
you run the program. When you press this key when the menu is displayed,
the menu item will be selected.

a| To quickly test what the menu will look like in your application,
use the *link:../userinterface/toolbar.html[Test/Preview]*
image:../userinterface/images/test.png[image,width=16,height=16]
command. To use this feature, click on the
*link:../userinterface/toolbar.html[Test/Preview]*
image:../userinterface/images/test.png[image,width=16,height=16] button
in the *link:../userinterface/toolbar.html[Toolbar]* above the
*link:../userinterface/design_view.html[Design View]* or
link:../userinterface/context_menu.html[right-click] in the
*link:../userinterface/design_view.html[Design View]* and select
*link:../userinterface/context_menu.html[Test/Preview]*.

a| In addition to creating a menu bar, you can also create a popup menu
for any control, including the window. Simply select *Popup Menu* (SWT)
or *JPopupMenu* (Swing) from the
*link:../userinterface/palette.html[Palette]*, move it over to the
desired control in the *link:../userinterface/design_view.html[Design
View]* and click to place it on that control. Only one popup menu can be
placed on a control. After a popup menu is placed on a control, a little
menu icon will appear on that control as shown below. The popup menu
will also automatically open, so that you can drop menu items on it.

a| If you click away from the popup menu, it will disappear. If you click
on the popup menu icon, the popup menu will reappear.

a| Adding menu items to the popup menu is identical to adding menu items
to the dropdown menus on the menu bar. To see your popup menu at work, use
the *link:../userinterface/toolbar.html[Test/Preview]*
image:../userinterface/images/test.png[image,width=16,height=16] command
and right-click on the control you added the popup menu to. The menu you
created will now appear.

As you have seen above, creating menus in the editor is very quick and
easy. Adding a selection event handler for the menu item is also easy.
Simply double-click a menu item and a selection event handler will be
created for you.
