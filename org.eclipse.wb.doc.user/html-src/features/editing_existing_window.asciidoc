= Editing Existing Windows

To open a file that has not been created by the tool or that is
currently edited by a different editor (such as the standard *Java
Editor*), simply right-click on the file and select *Open With >
WindowBuilder Editor*.

This will open the file in the *WindowBuilder* Editor in the
*link:../userinterface/source_view.html[Source View]* by default (the
editor layout may be easily customized if you prefer the
*link:../userinterface/design_view.html[Design View]* to appear first or
if you want the *link:../userinterface/source_view.html[Source View]*
and *link:../userinterface/design_view.html[Design View]* to appear at
the same time). There are two tabs at the bottom of the editor window
labeled *Source* and *Design* as shown below. If you click on the
*Design* tab or hit *F12*, the file will be displayed in the
*link:../userinterface/design_view.html[Design View]* and you will be
able to visually design your GUI.

*Note:* If a file was last opened in the *WindowBuilder* Editor , it
will continue to open in that editor until a different editor is
selected to edit the file. If you do not see the *Source* and *Design*
tabs, this means that you are not using the *WindowBuilder* Editor.
