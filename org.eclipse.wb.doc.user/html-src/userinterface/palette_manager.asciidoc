= Palette Manager

image:images/palette_context_menu2.png[image]
The *Palette Manager* may be accessed from the
xref:palette_context_menu.adoc[palette context menu].

The *Palette Manager* dialog allows the toolkit-specific palette to be
fully configured. Categories and entries may be added, edited,
rearranged and removed and JAR files imported.

Items may be rearranged using the *Up* and *Down* buttons or via drag
and drop. The *Collapse All* and *Expand All* buttons show or hide all
of the elements in the list.

Items may be hidden from the palette by unchecking the checkbox next to
their category or component name.

_If no widgets appear when you select a jar file, this is usually an
indication that the jar file does not provide a proper JavaBean manifest
readable by Sun's JavaBean manifest reader. Please contact the jar
provider for a correction. As long as the jar is on your project path,
you should be able to add individual widgets to the palette manually by
using the *Add Entry >>* command._
