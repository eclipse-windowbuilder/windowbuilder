= Property Pane

image:images/property_pane.png[image]

The *Property Pane* displays properties and events of the selected
components and provides editable text fields, lists and other controls
to allow you to edit properties and
xref:../features/event_handling.adoc[events]. Select the control in the
xref:component_tree.adoc[*Component Tree*] or on the
xref:design_view.adoc[*Design View*] to display its properties in the
*Property Pane*.  Once visible in the *Property Pane*, these values can
be edited.

When multiple controls are selected, all of their shared properties are
listed in the *Property Pane*. If not all the selected controls have the
same value for a property, the property editor in the *Property Pane*
will be blank.

By default, the *Property Pane* displays normal properties. Preferred
properties are shown in *bold* and expert properties are shown in
_italics_ (click the *Show advanced properties*
image:images/filter_advanced_properties.gif[image,width=16,height=16]
button to reveal them). A gray background indicates a property set to
its default value while a white background indicates a property that has
been set to a non-default value. Click the *Restore default value*
image:images/properties_default.gif[image,width=16,height=16] button to
set a property back to its default value.

You can select a property by clicking on the property title or value.
When a property is selected, an editor is displayed instead of the
value, so you can change it value. In most property editors *Enter*
should be used to apply the value, and *Esc* to return to the previous
value. If you select some property, you can use the arrow keys to
navigate between properties.

The *Property Pane* supports simple properties such as Strings and ints
and complex properties that consist of several other properties, such as
layouts and layout datas. Complex properties are displayed with a plus
or minus sign before the title. You can expand/collapse complex
properties in several different ways:

* double click on the property title or value
* single click on plus or minus sign
* select property and press
image:images/plus.png[image] to expand,
image:images/minus.png[image] to collapse

Some properties, such as xref:property_editor_string.adoc[strings],
xref:property_editor_color.adoc[colors],
xref:property_editor_font.adoc[fonts] and
xref:property_editor_image.adoc[images], provide a custom property
editor which can be access by clicking the
image:images/ellipses.png[image] button.

The state of a property (expanded or collapsed) is preserved between
selections of controls, so if you expand the property “style” for one
control and then select another control, the property “style” will
remain expanded, so you will able to quickly change the style value for
several properties without needing to expand it again and again. Once
you decide, that you don’t need to change the style, you can collapse
the property “style” and save space for other properties.

The *Property Pane* supports selection properties, i.e. properties, whose
values should be selected from some list. For example “type” property of
complex “style” property for Buttons is such a property. You can change its
value in the following ways:

* double click on the property value or for changing value to next value
in list (or first value, if current value is the last);
* select property and press Space to expand list and then use arrows to
change value;
* select property and press *Delete* to change value to default.

Right-click on the *Property Pane* to access the
xref:property_pane_context_menu.adoc[property pane context menu].
