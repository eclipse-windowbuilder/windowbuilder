= Source View

The *Source View* is where you write code by hand and review the code
generated by the tool. The *Source View* is simply the standard *Java
Editor* supplied by Eclipse and provided as a page within the editor. It
offers all of the same features as the standard *Java Editor* including:

* Syntax highlighting
* Content/code assist
* Code formatting
* Import assistance
* Quick fix
* Integrated debugging features

This *link:../preferences/index.html[Editor Layout]* preference controls
the position of the *Source View* relative to the
*link:design_view.html[Design View]*. By default, they are "on separate
notebook tabs" labeled *Source* and *Design* (you can select which page
is first). Additional options are provided to show the *Source View* and
*link:design_view.html[Design View]* side by side or one above the
other.
