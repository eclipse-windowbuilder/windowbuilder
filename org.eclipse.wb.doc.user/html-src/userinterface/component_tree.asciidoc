= Component Tree

image:images/component_tree.png[image]

The *Component Tree* shows the hierarchical relationship between all of
the components in the xref:design_view.adoc[*Design View*].

Each component in the tree shows is icon (with potential decorators),
its variable name and text label. Components may be represented as local
variables or fields, and variable names must be unique within the scope
in which the component is defined.

Icon decorators (see table below) are used to indicate whether a component
defines and events or is exposed as a public component of a custom container.

Expand the components in the tree using the *Expand All*
image:images/expand_all.gif[image] button, and
collapse them using the *Collapse All*
image:images/collapse_all.gif[image] button.

Right-click on an entry in the tree to access the same
xref:context_menu.adoc[context menu] available in the
xref:design_view.adoc[*Design View*]. Components may be re-arranged in
the tree via drag/drop and deleted using the *Delete* key.

Multiple components may be selected in the tree by holding down the
*Ctrl* key to add individual selections or the *Shift* key to add
contiguous selections.
