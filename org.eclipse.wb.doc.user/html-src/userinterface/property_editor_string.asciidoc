Enter single-line strings directly into the property pane or click the
image:images/ellipses.png[image] button to access the *String Editor*
and enter multi-line strings.

Multi-line strings may be entered in the *String Editor*, or values may
be selected from existing resource bundles. To use a value from a
resource bundle, check the *Use existing NLS source/key* checkbox and
click the *Browse* button. The *Choose Key* dialog will open where you
can select a String source and a key/value pair. You can filter the list
of key/value pairs that is shown by entering a string in the *Search
string* field. By default, key names are searched but you can also
search values or both keys and values by selecting the appropriate radio
button at the bottom of the dialog.
