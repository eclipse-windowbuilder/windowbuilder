= Structure View

The *Structure View* is composed of the
*xref:component_tree.adoc[Component Tree]* and the
*xref:property_pane.adoc[Property Pane]*. The
*xref:component_tree.adoc[Component Tree]* shows the hierarchical
relationship between all of the components in the design view, while the
*xref:property_pane.adoc[Property Pane]* displays properties and events
of the selected controls and provides editable text fields, lists and
other controls to allow you to edit properties and events

The position of the *Structure View* may be configured via drag and drop
or by right-clicking on the *Structure View* header and selecting the
*Dock On* command.
