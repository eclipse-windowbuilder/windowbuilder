_If no widgets appear when you select a jar file, this is usually an
indication that the jar file does not provide a proper JavaBean manifest
readable by Sun's JavaBean manifest reader. Please contact the jar
provider for a correction. As long as the jar is on your project path,
you should be able to add individual widgets to the palette manually by
using the *Add Component...* command._
