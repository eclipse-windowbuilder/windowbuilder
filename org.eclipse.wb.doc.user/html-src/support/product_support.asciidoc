= Product Support

We understand that sometimes time is of the essence, or you just need
more guidance than our manuals and examples provide. We have worked hard
to put together a series of support options to help you as promptly and
as thoroughly as you need.

*For support details, see the sections of this page:*

* xref:#contact[Requesting technical support]
* xref:test_cases.adoc[Reproducible Test cases]
* xref:#bug-found[Bugs and bug reports]
* xref:#support-form[Support Form]
* xref:../error_reporting.adoc[Error Reporting]

[#contact]
== Requesting Technical Support

The quickest mechanism for requesting support is to use the
*xref:../error_reporting.adoc[Error Reporting]* system included within
the product. Just click the *Create Report* button and submit the case
to the
*https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/discussions[WindowBuilder
forum]* or bug tracking system
(*https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues[GitHub >
Tools > WindowBuilder]*)..

If you are unable to use the *xref:../error_reporting.adoc[Error
Reporting]* system, please include our xref:#support-form[support form]
with the product name, version and platform with any forum support
requests. In addition, please be sure to provide the details on your
operating system and/or development environment. Your questions should
be concise and restricted to a single incident or request. If you have
any xref:test_cases.adoc[code] which may be relevant to the problem
please include it. Example xref:test_cases.adoc[code] that illustrates
the problem is especially welcome (and often leads to a quicker
resolution) as are debug logs generated in the event of a system
exception.

[#bug-found]
== What if I think I've found a bug?

We appreciate the help of our users in identifying bugs in our software.
Bugs are an inconvenience to all of us, but unfortunately the reality of
software development. We accept bug reports, using the form below, via
email, fax or phone. If an exception occurs within the product, you may
also use the xref:../error_reporting.adoc[error reporting] option.
