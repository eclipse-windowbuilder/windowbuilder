This page is used to control various *UI Toolkits* options.

WindowBuilder is designed with a plugable system to support creating
user interfaces in different UI toolkits. The available toolkits include
SWT, Swing, and the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). +
 +
The preference page shows the available toolkits and indicates which
ones are already installed. The list of available toolkits is refreshed
from the Eclipse servers when the preference page is opened. To install
a new UI toolkit into WindowBuilder, select the desired toolkit and
click the *Install Toolkits...* button. WindowBuilder will verify that
the toolkit's update site is live and then hand off the installation
process to the standard Eclipse install dialog.

Installed tookits may be uninstalled using he *Uninstall Toolkit*
button.

The *Show uninstalled toolkits in the new wizard dialog* determines
whether uninstalled toolkits show up with a placeholder in the *New
Wizard* under the *WindowBuilder* category.

Eclipse install dialog as shown above.
