This page is used to control various *Usage Profiler* options.

The tool can log the use of its features and will periodically transmit
this information to our servers. The data is anonymized and not shared
with third parties. We use the compiled data to determine where to
direct our future efforts.

== Enable usage profiling

The Usage Profiler may be enabled with automatic data uploading, enabled
with prompting prior to uploading (approximately once per week), or
disabled.
