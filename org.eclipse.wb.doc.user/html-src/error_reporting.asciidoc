== Error Reporting

When something unexpected happens (such as an exception being thrown)
while trying to parse a user interface class or perform a design view
operation, the editor will display the following error page:

The *link:#CreateReportDialog[Create Report]* button opens up an error
reporting dialog that will create a bug report that you can submit to
the bug tracking system along with all the needed supporting details.

The *Reparse* button will cause the current class to be reparsed.

The *Switch to code* button will switch the editor back to the *Source*
view.

Clicking the *Show stack trace* link will reveal the captured stack
trace. Clicking the link a second time will hide the stack trace.

[#CreateReportDialog]
== Create Report Dialog

Clicking the *Create Report* button will open the *Create Report
Dialog*:

The dialog contains several fields for entering information about the
problem and several options for attaching important support info:

* The Eclipse workspace *.metadata/.log* file is attached. This contains
any exceptions triggered as part of the error.
* A *link:#Screenshots[screenshot]* of the design view immediately prior
to the exception will be attached. Additional screenshots may be
attached.
* The *Compilation unit of error* (the currently edited class) may be
optionally attached (this is recommended).
link:support/test_cases.html[Reproducible test cases] are very important
for quick problem resolution.
* The *Entire project of error* (the currently edited project) may be
optionally attached (recommended if the current class has a lot of
dependencies). link:support/test_cases.html[Reproducible test cases] are
very important for quick problem resolution, so including any classes
needed to compile the class you are editing can be important.
* A *link:#SoftwareHardwareSummary[Software and hardware summary]* is
automatically attached to the case in order to identify any possible
conflicts.
* The WindowBuilder *preferences* are automatically attached to the
case.
* Any additional *link:#FileAttachments[File attachments]* may be
optionally added to the case (your *eclipse.ini* file, for example, or
any other classes needed by the class you are editing).

Clicking the *OK* button will generate a ZIP file that should be
manually submitted to the
*https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/discussions[WindowBuilder
discussions]* or bug tracking system
(*https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder/issues[GitHub
Issues]*).
