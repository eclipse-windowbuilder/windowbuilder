= EMF Data Bindings

Click the *Bindings* tab in the editor to created and edit data bindings.

SWT uses simple bindings between targets and models.

== Target & Model Types

In addition to the standard *Beans* and *Widgets* bindings, and additional EMF binding type is available when EMF
projects/model objects are detected.

*image:images/data_binding_emf_button.gif[image] Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)*: any EMF model object present in the
current compilation unit may be selected. The filter field above the list can be used to filter the list of models. The
image:images/clear_filter_button.gif[image] clear button can be used to clear the filter and restore the full list.

== Properties

When any *Target* or *Model* object is selected, its EMF model properties are shown in the associated *Properties* list.
A drop down filter menu is available to filter the Property list by type. Supported filters are *String*, *Boolean*,
*Numbers*, *Color* and *Font*.

== New EMF Bindings

New bindings are created by selecting a *Target*, a *Target Property*, a *Source*, a *Source Property* and clicking the
image:images/binding_button.gif[image] *Bind* button. When creating a binding, the update strategy from *target to model* and
*model to target* may be specified as well as any strategy-specific properties (validators and converters).

When new bindings are created between a *Viewer* and a list of model objects, the *Content Provider* and
*Label Provider* may be specified.

== Source

As bindings are created or edited on the Bindings tab, the necessary data binding code is generated which may then be
seen in the *Source* view. An *initDataBindings()* method is created, if it does not already exist and a call to that
method is added to the end of the widget creation process.

Within the *initDataBindings()* method, any needed observables are created first followed by the creation of the
*Data Binding Context*. Simple SWT data bindings are then created using the new context followed by any EMF model
bindings that are needed.

WARNING: _do not edit the *initDataBinding()* method by hand (without carefully matching the code generation pattern
used by the tool) as it will be regenerated in its entirety any time the tool needs to add, remove or update a data
binding._
