= Edit Data Binding Dialog

The tool provides two ways to quickly edit existing Data Bindings: the *Data Bindings* menu and the *bindings property*
in the property pane.

== Data Binding Menu

The *Data Bindings* menu provides the ability to quickly edit a data binding for a widget. If the widget has existing
data bindings, those are shown at the top of the cascaded menu and a list of widget properties is shown in a submenu.
Clicking on a bound property will open the *Edit Data Binding* dialog.

== Bindings Property

The *bindings property* in the property pane opens up to show a list of all bindable properties of the widget. Clicking
the image:images/dot-dot-dot-button.gif[image] button next to a bound property will open the *Edit Data Binding* dialog.

The *Edit Data Binding* dialog is used to customize the properties of the data binding itself. When editing a binding,
the update strategy from *target to model* and *model to target* may be specified as well as any strategy-specific
properties (validators and converters).

When the Target or Model is a Text widget and the text property is selected, the triggering event may be specified as
*SWT.Modify*, *SWT.FocusOut* or *SWT.NONE*.

Predefined update value strategies - *POLICY_UPDATE*, *POLICY_NEVER*, *POLICY_ON_REQUEST* and *POLICY_CONVERT* - may be
selected or a custom strategy class may chosen.

When binding to a *selection* object, the entire object may be bound to using the *Selection as object* radio button or
one of its fields may be bound to using the *Part of selection* radio button. When *Part of selection* is chosen, the
type of the selection should be specified in the *Class* field. A property specific to the specified class may then be
specified.
|===

If the *Strategy Properties* section is expanded for either the *Target* or *Model*, validators (AfterConvert, AfterGet
and BeforeSet) and converters can be specified.

If necessary, the resulting binding object can be assigned to a field. This can be useful when you need to bind to the
*validationStatus* of the binding itself.

== Source

Clicking the *Finish* button will generate the necessary data binding code which may then be seen in the *Source* view.
An *initDataBindings()* method is created, if it does not already exist and a call the that method is added to the end
of the widget creation process. Any needed observables are created first followed by the creation of the
*Data Binding Context*. The data bindings are then created using the new context.

WARNING: _do not edit the *initDataBinding()* method by hand (without carefully matching the code generation pattern used by
the tooll) as it will be regenerated in its entirety any time the tool needs to add, remove or update a data binding._
