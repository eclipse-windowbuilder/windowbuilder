= Layouts

image:images/preferences_layouts.gif[image]

This page is used to control various *SWT > Layouts* options.

== Default layout manager

This preference controls the default layout manager that *SWT Designer* uses for any new frame or panel. The default is
to use the implicit layout manager already in effect for each container (e.g., BorderLayout for JFrames and FlowLayout
for JPanels).

== Layouts to use

This preference controls the layouts which can be selected in the default layout manager and also which layouts are
available in the Design editor page.

If a layout is unchecked that is currently set as default layout, the selection in the default layout manager control is
cleared, with the implict layout being used as default again.

== Containers automatically use layout manager type of parent

This preference determines whether new panels will use the layout manager of their parent's by default.

== Create variable for Layout using pattern

This preference determines what pattern will be used to generate layout variables. The following styles are supported:

* $\{layoutAcronym}_$\{compositeName} -- gl_composite
* $\{layoutAcronym}$\{compositeName-cap} -- glComposite
* $\{compositeName}$\{layoutClassName} -- compositeGridLayout
* $\{dataDefaultName} -- gridLayout_1

== Create variable for LayoutData using pattern

This preference determines what pattern will be used to generate layout data variables. The following styles are
supported:

* $\{dataAcronym}_$\{controlName} -- gd_helloWorldButton
* $\{dataAcronym}$\{controlName-cap} -- gdHelloWorldButton
* $\{controlName}$\{dataClassName} -- helloWorldGridData
* $\{dataDefaultName} -- gridData_1
