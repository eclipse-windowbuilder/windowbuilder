= Code Generation

image:images/preferences_code_generation.gif[image]

== Use the existing creation style when it can be deduced

This preference determines whether *SWT Designer* attempts to use the existing code creation style already in a file to
generate code. *SWT Designer* checks a file when it is opened in the editor to see if one style or the other is used.
If only one of the styles is being used in a file, it will continue generating code in that style, regardless of what
the other code generation settings. If no style is detected (no controls have been created yet) or if more than one
style is detected, the *SWT Designer* will generate code as specified in the other settings.

== Method name for new statements

image:images/code_generation_method_name.gif[image]

This preference determines in which method components will be created by default (in the event that a suitable method
has not already be defined for the current class). If the method does not exist, it will be created and a call to it
added to the constructor for the class. Various default choices are provided to match the code generation patterns of
other GUI builders.

== Default code generation settings

*SWT Designer* supports a wide variety of code generation styles and can emulate most other Java GUI builders including
NetBeans, JBuilder, the Eclipse Visual Editor, etc. Choose a xref:#Variable[*Variable Generation*] style
(xref:#Local[*Local*] or xref:#Field[*Field*]) and a xref:#Statement[*Statement Generation*] style (xref:#Flat[*Flat*]
or xref:#Block[*Block*]). Many of the styles have additional options that can be set. Once any combination of settings
is selected, you can see a preview of that code generation style in the *Preview* pane.

[#Variable]
== Variable generation

*SWT Designer* supports several *Variable Generation* styles including xref:#Local[*Local*] or xref:#Field[*Field*].

[#Local]
== Local Variable Mode

image:images/code_generation_local.gif[image]

In the *Local* variable generation style, each component is assigned to a unique local variable and initialized at the
point of declaration. An option is provided to declare each variable as *final*. Note that component types marked as
*As Field* on the xref:preferences_variables.adoc#TypeSpecific[*Variables > Type Specific*] preference page will always
be assigned to fields.

[#Field]
== Field Mode

image:images/code_generation_field.gif[image]

In the *Field* generation style, each component is assigned to a unique field and initialized at the point where it is
first used. An option is provided to prefix each field reference with *this*.

[#Statement]
== Statement generation

*SWT Designer* supports *flat* mode and *block* mode generation modes.

[cols="^1,^1"]

a| [#Flat]
*Flat Mode*

image:images/code_generation_flat.gif[image]

In *flat* mode, each component is created in the same scope at the same indentation level. An option is provided to
prefix the creation of each component with either a blank line or a comment.
a| [#Block]
*Block Mode*

image:images/code_generation_block.gif[image]

In *block* mode, each component is created in its own scoped code block. Child components are created in nested blocks.
