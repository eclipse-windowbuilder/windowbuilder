== SWT GroupLayout

*GroupLayout* is a LayoutManager that hierarchically groups components in order to position them in a Container.
*GroupLayout* is intended for use by builders, but may be hand-coded as well. Grouping is done by instances of the
*Group* class. *GroupLayout* supports two types of groups. A sequential group positions its child elements sequentially,
one after another. A parallel group aligns its child elements in one of four ways.

Each group may contain any number of elements, where an element is a *Group*, *Component*, or gap. A gap can be thought
of as an invisible component with a minimum, preferred and maximum size. In addition GroupLayout supports a preferred
gap, whose value comes from *LayoutStyle*.

Elements are similar to a spring. Each element has a range as specified by a minimum, preferred and maximum. Gaps have
either a developer-specified range, or a range determined by *LayoutStyle*. The range for Components is determined from
the Component's *getMinimumSize*, *getPreferredSize* and *getMaximumSize* methods. In addition, when adding Components
you may specify a particular range to use instead of that from the component. The range for a *Group* is determined by
the type of group. A *ParallelGroup's* range is the maximum of the ranges of its elements. A *SequentialGroup's* range
is the sum of the ranges of its elements.

*GroupLayout* treats each axis independently. That is, there is a group representing the horizontal axis, and a group
representing the vertical axis. The horizontal group is responsible for determining the minimum, preferred and maximum
size along the horizontal axis as well as setting the x and width of the components contained in it. The vertical group
is responsible for determining the minimum, preferred and maximum size along the vertical axis as well as setting the y
and height of the components contained in it. Each Component must exist in both a horizontal and vertical group,
otherwise an *IllegalStateException* is thrown during layout, or when the minimum, preferred or maximum size is
requested.
