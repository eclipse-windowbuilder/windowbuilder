= SWT RowLayout

*RowLayout* determines the size and position of the children of a *Composite* by placing them either in horizontal rows
or vertical columns within the parent *Composite*. *RowLayout* aligns all controls in one row if the type is set to
horizontal, and one column if it is set to vertical. It has the ability to wrap, and provides configurable margins and
spacing. *RowLayout* has a number of configuration fields. In addition, the height and width of each control in a
*RowLayout* can be specified by setting a *RowData* object into the control using *setLayoutData()*.
