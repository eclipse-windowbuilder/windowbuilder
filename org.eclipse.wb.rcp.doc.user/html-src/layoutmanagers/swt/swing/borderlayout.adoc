= Swing BorderLayout

*BorderLayout* lays out a container, arranging and resizing its components to fit in five regions: *north*, *south*,
*east*, *west*, and *center*. Each region may contain no more than one component, and is identified by a corresponding
constant: *NORTH*, *SOUTH*, *EAST*, *WEST*, and *CENTER*. When adding a component to a container with a border layout,
use one of these five constants. As a convenience, *BorderLayout* interprets the absence of a string specification the
same as the constant *CENTER*.
