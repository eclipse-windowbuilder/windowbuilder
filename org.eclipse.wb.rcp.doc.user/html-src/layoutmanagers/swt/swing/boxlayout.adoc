= Swing BoxLayout

*BoxLayout* allows multiple components to be laid out either vertically or horizontally. The components will not wrap
so, for example, a vertical arrangement of components will stay vertically arranged when the frame is resized. Nesting
multiple panels with different combinations of horizontal and vertical gives an effect similar to *GridBagLayout*,
without the complexity. The *BoxLayout* manager is constructed with an axis parameter that specifies the type of layout
that will be done. For all directions, components are arranged in the same order as they were added to the container.

*BoxLayout* attempts to arrange components at their preferred widths (for horizontal layout) or heights (for vertical
layout). For a horizontal layout, if not all the components are the same height, *BoxLayout* attempts to make all the
components as high as the highest component. If that's not possible for a particular component, then *BoxLayout* aligns
that component vertically, according to the component's Y alignment. By default, a component has a Y alignment of 0.5,
which means that the vertical center of the component should have the same Y coordinate as the vertical centers of other
components with 0.5 Y alignment. Similarly, for a vertical layout, *BoxLayout* attempts to make all components in the
column as wide as the widest component. If that fails, it aligns them horizontally according to their X alignments.
