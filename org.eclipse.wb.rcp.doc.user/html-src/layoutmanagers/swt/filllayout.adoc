= SWT FillLayout

*FillLayout* is the simplest layout class. It lays out controls in a single row or column, forcing them to be the same
size. Initially, the controls will all be as tall as the tallest control, and as wide as the widest. *FillLayout* does
not wrap, but you can specify margins and spacing. You might use it to lay out buttons in a task bar or tool bar, or to
stack checkboxes in a Group. *FillLayout* can also be used when a *Composite* only has one child. For example, if a
*Shell* has a single Group child, *FillLayout* will cause the *Group* to completely fill the *Shell* (if margins are 0).
