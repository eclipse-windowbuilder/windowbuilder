= SWT GridLayout


*GridLayout* lays out the control children of a Composite in a grid. *GridLayout* has a number of configuration fields,
and the controls it lays out can have an associated layout data object, called *GridData*. The power of *GridLayout*
lies in the ability to configure *GridData* for each control in the layout. The *numColumns* field is the most important
field in a *GridLayout*. Widgets are laid out in columns from left to right, and a new row is created when
*numColumns + 1* controls are added to the Composite.
