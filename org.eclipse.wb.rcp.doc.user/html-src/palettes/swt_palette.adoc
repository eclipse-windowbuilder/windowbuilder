* *RadioItem*          - Instances of this class represent a selectable user interface object that represents an radio
                         button in a radio group.
* *RadioGroupViewer*   - A concrete viewer based on a Nebula RadioGroup control.
* *TableCombo*         - The TableCombo class represents a selectable user interface object that combines a label,
                         textfield, and a table and issues notification when an item is selected from the table.

* *ColumnLayout*        - This layout manager arranges children of the composite parent in vertical columns. All the
                          columns are identical size and children are stretched horizontally to fill the column width.
                          The goal is to give layout some reasonable range of column numbers to allow it to handle
                          various parent widths. That way, column number will drop to the lowest number in the range
                          when width decreases, and grow up to the highest number in the range when allowed by the
                          parent width.
* *TableWrapLayout*     - This implementation of the layout algorithm attempts to position controls in the composite
                          using a two-pass autolayout HTML table algorithm recommeded by HTML 4.01 W3C specification.
                          The main differences with GridLayout is that it has two passes and that width and height are
                          not calculated in the same pass.
* *Button*              - Instances of this class represent a selectable user interface object that issues notification
                          when pressed and released.
* *Composite*           - Instances of this class are controls which are capable of containing other controls.
* *Composite Separator* - Creates the composite that can serve as a separator between various parts of a form. Separator
                          height should be controlled by setting the height hint on the layout data for the composite.
* *Label*               - Instances of this class represent a non-selectable user interface object that displays a
                          string or image. When SEPARATOR is specified, displays a single vertical or horizontal line.
* *Hyperlink*           - Hyperlink is a concrete implementation of the abstract base class that draws text in the
                          client area. Text can be wrapped and underlined. Hyperlink is typically added to the hyperlink
                          group so that certain properties are managed for all the hyperlinks that belong to it.
* *ImageHyperlink*      - This class extends hyperlink widget by adding the capability to render an image relative to
                          the text. If no text has been set, only image will be shown. Images for hover and active
                          states can be set in addition to the normal state image.
* *FormText*            - This class is a read-only text control that is capable of rendering wrapped text. Text can be
                          rendered as-is or by parsing the formatting XML tags. Independently, words that start with
                          http:// can be converted into hyperlinks on the fly.
* *Separator*           - A horizontal or vertical line used to separate other controls.
* *Table*               - Instances of this class implement a selectable user interface object that displays a list of
                          images and strings and issue notification when selected.
* *Text*                - Instances of this class are selectable user interface objects that allow the user to enter and
                          modify text.
* *Tree*                - Instances of this class provide a selectable user interface object that displays a hierarchy
                          of items and issue notification when an item in the hierarchy is selected.
* *ExpandableComposite* - This composite is capable of expanding or collapsing a single client that is its direct child.
                          The composite renders an expansion toggle affordance (according to the chosen style), and a
                          title that also acts as a hyperlink (can be selected and is traversable). The client is layed
                          out below the title when expanded, or hidden when collapsed.
* *Section*             - A variation of the expandable composite that adds optional description below the title.
                          Section is often used as a basic building block in forms because it provides for logical
                          grouping of information.
* *Form*                - Form is a custom control that renders a title and an optional background image above the body
                          composite. It can be used alone when part of parents that are scrolled. If scrolling is
                          required, use ScrolledForm instead because it has an instance of Form and adds scrolling
                          capability.
* *ScrolledForm*        - ScrolledForm is a control that is capable of scrolling an instance of the Form class. It
                          should be created in a parent that will allow it to use all the available area (for example,
                          a shell, a view or an editor).

* *External*    - Allows to select some existing Action type (in separate external class) and drop it on design canvas.
* *Separator*   - A separator is a special kind of contribution item which acts as a visual separator and, optionally,
                  acts as a group marker. Unlike group markers, separators do have a visual representation for menus and
                  toolbars.
* *MenuManager* - Creates a new MenuManager to represent a top-level pull down menu or a cascade menu.
