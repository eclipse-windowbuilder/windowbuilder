image:images/wizard_rcp_perspective0.gif[image]

Implementors of the Eclipse RCP *IPerspectiveFactory* interface can be created using the *RCP Perspective* wizard. The
wizard can be selected from the drop down Designer wizard menu or from the Eclipse *New* wizard.

To use the wizard, select the project source folder and package to contain the class. Then enter the class name and
editor name and hit the *Finish* button.

The wizard generates the following code.

[source,java]
----
import org.eclipse.ui.IPageLayout;
import org.eclipse.ui.IPerspectiveFactory;

public class SamplePerspective implements IPerspectiveFactory {
	public void createInitialLayout(IPageLayout layout) {
		String editorArea = layout.getEditorArea();
		addFastViews(layout);
		addViewShortcuts(layout);
		addPerspectiveShortcuts(layout);
	}

	private void addFastViews(IPageLayout layout) {
	}

	private void addViewShortcuts(IPageLayout layout) {
	}

	private void addPerspectiveShortcuts(IPageLayout layout) {
	}
}
----

If the Perspective is created in an existing plugin project, the plugin.xml file is also updated with the appropriate
perspective declaration.

Perspectives use their own unique palette. The first palette category, Local, contains a list of all of the views
defined in the local plugin.xml file. Additional categories, such as Standard, Java, Debug and Misc, contain common
views frequently used in perspectives. The actual categories shown will depend on prerequisite plugins defined by the
current plugin (i.e., the Java category will only appear is the Eclipse JDT plugins are prerequisites of the current
plugin. The last category, Perspectives, lists all of the perspectives available in the system.

Views may be dragged and dropped within the design area. Dropping one view on another will automatically create a
folder. Views may be set as placeholders or dragged to the fast view dock at the bottom of the perspective or to the
view shortcut dock to the right of the perspective. Perspectives may only be dragged to the perspective shortcut doc to
the right of the perspective.
