Subclasses of the RCP ViewPart class can be created using the Forms ViewPart wizard. The wizard can be selected from the
drop down wizard menu or from the Eclipse *New* wizard.

To use the wizard, select the project source folder and package to contain the class. Then enter the class name and hit
the *Finish* button.

The wizard generates the following code.

	public FormsViewPart() {

When editing RCP ViewParts, all of the standard SWT layouts, containers and widgets are available.

If the ViewPart is created in an existing plugin project, the plugin.xml file is also updated with the appropriate view
declaration.

When editing ViewParts, SWT Designer adds a new Palette category, *JFace Actions*, for defining actions and assigning
them to the view's toolbar and menu.

New actions may be created using the *New* command, and existing actions may be added using the *External* command. New
actions are created as inner classes of the current class and are automatically added to the palette for easy access.
Any existing actions may be deleted using the *Delete* key. Selecting an action allows you to edit its icons, label and
tool tip text within the property pane.

The view's toolbar is live and actions may be dropped on it. Actions and separators may be dragged from the palette and
dropped on the toolbar. Toolbar actions may be rearranged using drag/drop and deleted using the *Delete* key.

The view's menu is also live and actions may be dropped on it. Actions, separators and menu managers may be dragged from
the palette and dropped into the menu. Menus may be rearranged using drag/drop and deleted using the *Delete* key.

When the ViewPart itself is selected in the property pane, its *name* and *icon* may be edited as part of the
*Extension* property.
