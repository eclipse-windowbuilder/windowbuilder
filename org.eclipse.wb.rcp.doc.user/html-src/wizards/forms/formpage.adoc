Subclasses of the Eclipse Forms *FormPage* class can be created using the *Forms FormPage* wizard. The wizard can be
selected from the drop down Designer wizard menu or from the Eclipse *New* wizard.

To use the wizard, select the project source folder and package to contain the class. Then enter the class name and hit
the *Finish* button.

For more information on using Eclipse Forms, see the
link:https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Forms/article.html[Eclipse Forms Programming Guide].

The wizard generates the following code.

[source,java]
----
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite; 
import org.eclipse.ui.forms.IManagedForm; 
import org.eclipse.ui.forms.editor.FormEditor; 
import org.eclipse.ui.forms.editor.FormPage; 
import org.eclipse.ui.forms.widgets.FormToolkit; 
import org.eclipse.ui.forms.widgets.ScrolledForm; 
  
public class FormsFormPage extends FormPage { 
	public FormsFormPage(String id, String title) { 
		super(id, title); 
	}

	public FormsFormPage(FormEditor editor, String id, String title) { 
		super(editor, id, title); 
	}

	protected void createFormContent(IManagedForm managedForm) { 
		FormToolkit toolkit = managedForm.getToolkit(); 
		ScrolledForm form = managedForm.getForm(); 
		form.setText("Empty FormPage"); 
		Composite body = form.getBody();
		toolkit.decorateFormHeading(form.getForm());
		toolkit.paintBordersFor(body); 
	} 
}

When editing Eclipse Forms FormPages, a set of specialized *Eclipse Forms widgets* is available with their own unique
widget palette. These widgets provide the "flat" look that is a signature element of the Eclipse Forms API. Standard
widgets and layout managers can also be used although they won't use the flat look.
