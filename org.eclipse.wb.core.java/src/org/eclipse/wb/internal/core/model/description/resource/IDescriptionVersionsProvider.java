/**
 * Components may change during when toolkit or library evolve, so we add new features into
 * descriptions in "wbp-meta" folder. However when we reference some method or property that does
 * not exist in older version of component, this will cause critical exception. So, we should have
 * separate descriptions for older versions of components and try to load them first from some
 * sub-folders of "wbp-meta", before loading directly from "wbp-meta" folder.
 * <p>
 * This class provides possible sub-folders with versions of component resources that should be
 * checked.
