/**
 * {@link CreationSupport} that implements this interface can be used for create "live component" by
 * {@link AbstractLiveManager}. "Live components" are used to fetch some data used during visual
 * creation of the component, such as image, preferred size, etc.
 * <p>
 * We need this interface because we need to create full copy of {@link JavaInfo} during adding it
 * in temporary hierarchy. So, we should also create copy of {@link CreationSupport} that also
 * should be aware, that it will be used for "live component".
