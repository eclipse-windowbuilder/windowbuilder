/**
 * A GdkRectangle data type for representing rectangles.
 *
 * GdkRectangle is identical to cairo_rectangle_t. Together with Cairoâ€™s
 * cairo_region_t data type, these are the central types for representing sets
 * of pixels.
 *
 * The intersection of two rectangles can be computed with
 * gdk_rectangle_intersect(); to find the union of two rectangles use
 * gdk_rectangle_union().
 *
 * The cairo_region_t type provided by Cairo is usually used for managing
 * non-rectangular clipping of graphical operations.
 *
 * The Graphene library has a number of other data types for regions and volumes
 * in 2D and 3D.
