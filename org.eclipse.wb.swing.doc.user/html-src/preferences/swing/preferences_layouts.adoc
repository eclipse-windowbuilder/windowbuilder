= Layouts

image:images/preferences_layouts.gif[image]

This page is used to control various *Swing > Layouts* options.

== Default layout manager

This preference controls the default layout manager that *Swing Designer* uses for any new frame or panel. The default
is to use the implicit layout manager already in effect for each container (e.g., BorderLayout for JFrames and
FlowLayout for JPanels).

== Layouts to use

This preference controls the layouts which can be selected in the default layout manager and also which layouts are
available in the Design editor page.

If a layout is unchecked that is currently set as default layout, the selection in the default layout manager control is
cleared, with the implict layout being used as default again.

== Containers automatically use layout manager type of parent

This preference determines whether new panels will use the layout manager of their parent's by default.

== Create variable for Layout using pattern

This preference determines what pattern will be used to generate layout variables. The following styles are supported:

- $\{layoutAcronym}_$\{containerName} - gbl_panel
- $\{layoutAcronym}$\{containerName-cap} - gblPanel
- $\{containerName}$\{layoutClassName} - panelGridBagLayout
- $\{dataDefaultName} - gridBagLayout_1
