- *JPanel*         - A generic lightweight container.
- *JScrollPane*    - Provides a scrollable view of a lightweight component. A JScrollPane manages a viewport, optional
                     vertical and horizontal scroll bars, and optional row and column heading viewports.
- *JSplitPane*     - JSplitPane is used to divide two (and only two) Components. The two Components are graphically
                     divided based on the look and feel implementation, and the two Components can then be interactively
                     resized by the user.
- *JTabbedPane*    - A component that lets the user switch between a group of components by clicking on a tab with a
                     given title and/or icon.
- *JToolBar*       - A component that is useful for displaying commonly used Action's or controls.
- *JDesktopPane*   - A container used to create a multiple-document interface or a virtual desktop.
- *JInternalFrame* - A lightweight object that provides many of the features of a native frame, including dragging,
                     closing, becoming an icon, resizing, title display, and support for a menu bar.

- *JLabel*                - A display area for a short text string or an image, or both. A label does not react to input
                            events. As a result, it cannot get the keyboard focus. A label can, however, display a
                            keyboard alternative as a convenience for a nearby component that has a keyboard alternative
                            but can't display it.

                            select a value from the drop-down list, which appears at the user's request. If you make the
                            combo box editable, then the combo box includes an editable field into which the user can
                            type a value.
- *JButton*               - An implementation of a "push" button.

                            displays its state to the user. By convention, any number of check boxes in a group can be
                            selected.
- *JRadioButton*          - An implementation of a radio button -- an item that can be selected or deselected, and which
                            displays its state to the user. Used with a ButtonGroup object to create a group of buttons
                            in which only one button at a time can be selected.
- *JToggleButton*         - An implementation of a two-state button -- an item that can be selected or deselected, and
                            which displays its state to the user.

                            mask.
- *JPasswordField*        - A lightweight component that allows the editing of a single line of text where the view
                            indicates something was typed, but does not show the original characters.
- *JTextPane*             - A text component that can be marked up with attributes that are represented graphically.
- *JEditorPane*           - A text component to edit various kinds of content.
- *JSpinner*              - A lightweight component that allows the lets the user select a number or an object value
                            from an ordered sequence.

- *JTable on JScrollPane* - A JTable placed within a JScrollPane.
- *Table model column*    - A JTable model column.
- *JTree*                 - A control that displays a set of hierarchical data as an outline.
- *JProgressBar*          - A component that, by default, displays an integer value within a bounded interval. A
                            progress bar typically communicates the progress of some work by displaying its percentage
                            of completion and possibly a textual display of this percentage.
- *JScrollBar*            - An implementation of a scrollbar. The user positions the knob in the scrollbar to determine
                            the contents of the viewing area. The program typically adjusts the display so that the end
                            of the scrollbar represents the end of the displayable contents, or 100% of the contents.
- *JSeparator*            - A horizontal or vertical line used to separate other controls.
- *JSlider*               - A component that lets the user graphically select a value by sliding a knob within a bounded
                            interval. The slider can show both major tick marks and minor tick marks between them. The
                            number of values between the tick marks is controlled with setMajorTickSpacing and
                            setMinorTickSpacing.

- *Panel*      - Panel is the simplest container class. A panel provides space in which an application can attach any
                 other component, including other panels.
- *Canvas*     - A Canvas component represents a blank rectangular area of the screen onto which the application can
                 draw or from which the application can trap input events from the user.
- *ScrollPane* - A container class which implements automatic horizontal and/or vertical scrolling for a single child
                 component.
- *Button*     - This class creates a labeled button. The application can cause some action to happen when the button is
                 pushed.
- *Label*      - A Label object is a component for placing text in a container. A label displays a single line of
                 read-only text. The text can be changed by the application, but a user cannot edit itdirectly.
- *Checkbox*   - A check box is a graphical component that can be in either an "on" (true) or "off" (false) state.
                 Clicking on a check box changes its state from "on" to "off", or from "off" to "on".
- *Choice*     - The Choice class presents a pop-up menu of choices. The current choice is displayed as the title of the
                 menu.
- *List*       - The List component presents the user with a scrolling list of text items. The list can be set up so
                 that the user can choose either one item or multiple items.
- *Scrollbar*  - The Scrollbar class embodies a scroll bar, a familiar user-interface object. A scroll bar provides a
                 convenient means for allowing a user to select from a range of values.
- *TextField*  - A TextField object is a text component that allows for the editing of a single line of text.
- *TextArea*   - A TextArea object is a multi-line region that displays text. It can be set to allow editing or to be
