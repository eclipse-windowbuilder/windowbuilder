= JGoodies FormLayout

*JGoodies FormLayout* is a powerful, flexible and precise general purpose layout manager. It aligns components
vertically and horizontally in a dynamic rectangular grid of cells, with each component occupying one or more cells. A
whitepaper about the *FormLayout* available http://www.jgoodies.com/articles/forms.pdf[online]. To use *FormLayout* you
first define the grid by specifying the columns and rows. In a second step you add components to the grid. You can
specify columns and rows via human-readable String descriptions or via arrays of *ColumnSpec* and *RowSpec* instances.
Each component managed by a *FormLayout* is associated with an instance of *CellConstraints*. The constraints object
specifies where a component should be located on the form's grid and how the component should be positioned. In addition
to its constraints object the *FormLayout* also considers each component's minimum and preferred sizes in order to
determine a component's size.

This layout also requires the use of the *JGoodies FormLayout* jar file (forms-1.0.6.jar or higher).
