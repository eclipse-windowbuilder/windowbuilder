= Swing SpringLayout

SpringLayout class that implements an constraint-based layout manager.
With constraint-based layout, you have independent control over the
sizing behavior of each of the four sides of a widget. The top, bottom,
left, and right sides can be independently attached to the sides of the
parent container or the sides of any sibling widget within the same
container using either fixed or relative offsets. This proves to be
surprisingly powerful and can be used to emulate almost any of the other
layout managers. The SpringLayout class is very simple and only
specifies the margins of the container.
