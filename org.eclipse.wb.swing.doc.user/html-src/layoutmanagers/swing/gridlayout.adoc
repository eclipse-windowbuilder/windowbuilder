= Swing GridLayout

The *GridLayout* class is a layout manager that lays out a container's components in a rectangular grid. The container
is divided into equal-sized rectangles, and one component is placed in each rectangle. When both the number of rows and
the number of columns have been set to non-zero values, either by a constructor or by the *setRows* and *setColumns*
methods, the number of columns specified is ignored. Instead, the number of columns is determined from the specified
number of rows and the total number of components in the layout. So, for example, if three rows and two columns have
been specified and nine components are added to the layout, they will be displayed as three rows of three columns.
Specifying the number of columns affects the layout only when the number of rows is set to zero.
