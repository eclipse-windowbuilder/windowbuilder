= Swing FlowLayout

A *FlowLayout* arranges components in a directional flow, much like lines of text in a paragraph. *FlowLayouts* are
typically used to arrange buttons in a panel. It arranges buttons horizontally until no more buttons fit on the same
line. The line alignment is determined by the align property.
