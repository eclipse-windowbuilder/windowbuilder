= Swing CardLayout

A *CardLayout* object is a layout manager for a container. It treats each component in the container as a card. Only one
card is visible at a time, and the container acts as a stack of cards. The first component added to a *CardLayout*
object is the visible component when the container is first displayed. The ordering of cards is determined by the
container's own internal ordering of its component objects. *CardLayout* defines a set of methods that allow an
application to flip through these cards sequentially, or to show a specified card.
