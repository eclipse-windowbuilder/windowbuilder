= Swing GridBagLayout

The *GridBagLayout* class is a flexible layout manager that aligns components vertically, horizontally or along their
baseline without requiring that the components be of the same size. Each *GridBagLayout* object maintains a dynamic,
rectangular grid of cells, with each component occupying one or more cells, called its display area. Each component
managed by a *GridBagLayout* is associated with an instance of *GridBagConstraints*. The constraints object specifies
where a component's display area should be located on the grid and how the component should be positioned within its
display area. In addition to its constraints object, the *GridBagLayout* also considers each component's minimum and
preferred sizes in order to determine a component's size.
