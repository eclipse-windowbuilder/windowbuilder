= MiGLayout

*MiGLayout* is the most versatile and flexible Swing and SWT Layout Manager for Java, yet it is very easy to learn and
use. It is using String _or_ API type-checked constraints to format the layout. *MiGLayout* can produce flowing, grid
based, absolute (with links), grouped and docking layouts. You will never have to switch to another layout manager ever
again! *MiGLayout* is created to be to manually coded layouts what Matisse/GroupLayout is to IDE supported visual
layouts.

This layout also requires the use of the *MiGLayout* jar file (miglayout-3.6.jar or higher).
