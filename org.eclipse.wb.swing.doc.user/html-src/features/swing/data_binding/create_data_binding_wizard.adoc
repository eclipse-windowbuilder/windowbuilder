= Create Data Binding Wizard

The tool provides two ways to quickly create new Data Bindings: the *Data Bindings* menu and the *bindings property* in
the property pane.

Data Binding Menu
|
Bindings Property
|
The *Data Bindings* menu provides the ability to quickly create a data binding for a widget. If the widget does not have
any data bindings, the menu immediately cascades out to show the available properties of the widget that can be bound to
a model property. If the widget has existing data bindings, those are shown at the top of the cascaded menu and a list
of widget properties is shown in a submenu. Clicking on an unbound property will open the *Create Data Binding* wizard.
|
The *bindings property* in the property pane opens up to show a list of all bindable properties of the widget. Clicking
the image:images/dot-dot-dot-button.gif[image] button next to an unbound property will open the *Create Data Binding*
wizard.

== Choose Model

The first page of the *Create Data Binding* wizard is used to select the model and property to bind the selected target
property to. Two types of targets and models are supported:
image:images/data_binding_beans_button.gif[image] *Beans* and image:images/data_binding_widgets_button.gif[image]
*Widgets*. The filter field above the list can be used to filter the list of items. The
image:images/clear_filter_button.gif[image] clear button can be used to clear the filter and restore the full list.

- image:images/data_binding_beans_button.gif[image] *Beans*: any field of the current compilation unit may be selected.

- *image:images/data_binding_widgets_button.gif[image] Widgets*: any widget in the current compilation unit may be
selected.

When any *Model* object is selected, its properties (bean fields or standard Swing widget properties) are shown in the
associated *Properties* list. Properties may be expanded to show their nested attributes. A drop down filter menu is
available to filter the Property list by type and hide or show the advanced properties. Supported filters are *String*,
*Boolean*, *Numbers*, *Color*, *Font* and *Image*.

Once the model property has been selected, click the *Finish* button to create a new data binding using default options.
If you wish to customize the properties of the data binding, click the *Next* button to go to the second page of the
wizard.

== Properties

The second page of the *Create Data Binding* wizard is used to customize the properties of the data binding itself. When
creating a binding, the update strategy from *target to model* and *model to target* may be specified as well as any
strategy-specific properties (validators and converters).

When the Target or Model is a Text widget and the text property is selected, the triggering event may be specified as
*Swing.Modify*, *Swing.FocusOut* or *Swing.NONE*.

image:images/text_events.gif[image]

Predefined update value strategies - *READ_ONCE*, *READ* and *READ_WRITE* - may be selected.

== Source

Clicking the *Finish* button will generate the necessary data binding code which may then be seen in the *Source* view.
An *initDataBindings()* method is created, if it does not already exist and a call to that method is added to the end of
the widget creation process. Within the *initDataBindings()* method, any needed bean properties are created followed by
the creation of each binding.

WARNING: _do not edit the *initDataBinding()* method by hand (without carefully matching the code generation pattern
used by the tool) as it will be regenerated in its entirety any time the tool needs to add, remove or update a data
binding._
