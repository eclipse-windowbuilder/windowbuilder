Swing uses simple bindings between targets and models.

== Target & Model Types

Two types of targets and models are supported:

- image:images/data_binding_beans_button.gif[image] *Beans*: any field of the current compilation unit may be selected.
  The filter field above the list can be used to filter the list of beans. The
  image:images/clear_filter_button.gif[image] clear button can be used to clear the filter and restore the full list.
  *Beans* are the primary data source for bindings (usually the model). Any property of the *Bean* may be observed.
  Individual beans may also be expanded to reveal their direct sub properties. +

- image:images/data_binding_widgets_button.gif[image] *Widgets*: any widget in the current compilation unit may be
  selected. If a widget is not a field, it will be converted to a field automatically. The filter field above the list
  can be used to filter the list of widgets. The image:images/clear_filter_button.gif[image] clear button can be used to
  clear the filter and restore the full list. Any property of the *Widget* may be observed. +

== Properties

When any *Target* or *Model* object is selected, its properties (bean fields or standard Swing widget properties) are
shown in the associated *Properties* list. Properties may be expanded to show their nested attributes. A drop down
filter menu is available to filter the Property list by type and hide or show the advanced properties. Supported filters
are *String*, *Boolean*, *Numbers*, *Color*, *Font* and *Image*.

== New Swing Bindings

New bindings are created by selecting a *Target*, a *Target Property*, a *Source*, a *Source Property* and clicking the
image:images/binding_button.gif[image] *Bind* button. When creating a binding, the update strategy from
*target to model* and *model to target* may be specified as well as any strategy-specific properties (converter and
validator).

image:images/bind_properties_swing1.gif[image]

When the Target or Model is a Text widget and the text property is selected, the triggering event may be specified as
*Swing.Modify*, *Swing.FocusOut* or *Swing.NONE*.

image:images/text_events.gif[image]

Predefined update value strategies - *READ_ONCE*, *READ* and *READ_WRITE* - may be selected.

image:images/update_value_strategy.gif[image]

When binding to a *<EL Expression>*, a text field is provided where the expression may be entered.

image:images/bind_properties_swing2.gif[image]

When binding a JList to a collection of model objects, the detail of the model (what is shown in the list) can be
specified.

When binding a JTable to a collection of model objects, column bindings may be added for each model object property.

== Existing Swing Bindings

At the top of the page, existing *Bound Properties* are listed. The *Target* and *Model* are shown as well as the
*Strategy* and the *Binding* variable name.

image:images/bound_properties_swing.gif[image]

Clicking the image:images/data_binding_edit_button.gif[image] *Edit* button or *Edit* menu opens the *Edit Binding*
dialog where the update strategy, converter and validator may be modified.

image:images/edit_binding_swing.gif[image]

The image:images/data_binding_delete_button.gif[image] *Delete* button or *Delete* menu is used to delete the selected
bound property while the image:images/data_binding_delete_all_button.gif[image] *Delete All* button or *Delete All* menu
is used to delete all of the bound properties.

The image:images/data_binding_move_up_button.gif[image] *Move Up* and
image:images/data_binding_move_down_button.gif[image] *Move Down* buttons and menus are used to change the order of the
bindings while the image:images/data_binding_goto_definition_button.gif[image] *Goto Definition* button and menu are
used to jump to the generated code for the binding.

== Source

As bindings are created or edited on the Bindings tab, the necessary data binding code is generated which may then be
seen in the *Source* view. An *initDataBindings()* method is created, if it does not already exist and a call to that
method is added to the end of the widget creation process.

Within the *initDataBindings()* method, any needed bean properties are created followed by the creation of each binding.

image:images/data_binding_source.gif[image]

WARNING: _do not edit the *initDataBinding()* method by hand (without carefully matching the code generation pattern
used by the tool) as it will be regenerated in its entirety any time the tool needs to add, remove or update a data
binding._
