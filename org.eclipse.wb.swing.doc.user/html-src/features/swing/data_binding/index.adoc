= Swing Data Binding

NOTE: _In order to use Swing Data Binding (JSR 295), you must first add the Swing Data Binding jar
(e.g., beansbinding-1.2.1.jar) to your classpath._

The tool can create new *Data Bindings* in several different ways:

- Click the xref:#DataBindingTab[*Bindings*] tab in the editor to created and edit the bindings.
- Right-clicking on a widget and selecting the xref:#DataBindingMenu[*Data Binding*] menu.
- Expanding the xref:#BindingsProperty[*bindings*] property in the property pane.
- Use the xref:#AutomaticWizard[*Swing Automatic Data Binding*] wizard to create a complete user interface from a domain
  (bean) class.

The tool will generate or update any necessary data binding code which may then be seen in the xref:#Source[*Source*]
view.

Detailed link:example.html[data binding example] code is available link:SwingBindingsTest.zip[here].

[#DataBindingTab]
== Data Binding Tab

Click the *Bindings* tab in the editor to created and edit data bindings.

The *Bindings* tab supports the creation xref:swing_bindings.adoc[*JSR 295 Swing data bindings*].

[#DataBindingMenu]
== Data Binding Menu

The *Data Bindings* menu provides the ability to quickly create or edit data bindings for a widget. If the widget does
not have any data bindings, the menu immediately cascades out to show the available properties of the widget that can be
bound to a model property. If the widget has existing data bindings, those are shown at the top of the cascaded menu
followed by a separator and a list of widget properties. Clicking on an unbound property will open the
xref:create_data_binding_wizard.adoc[*Create Data Binding*] wizard while clicking a bound property will open the
xref:edit_data_binding_dialog.adoc[*Edit Data Binding*] dialog.

[#BindingsProperty]
== Bindings Property

The *bindings property* in the property pane opens up to show a list of all bindable properties of the widget. Clicking
the image:images/dot-dot-dot-button.gif[image] button next to an unbound property will open the 
xref:create_data_binding_wizard.adoc[*Create Data Binding*] wizard while clicking the
image:images/dot-dot-dot-button.gif[image] button next to a bound property will open the 
xref:edit_data_binding_dialog.adoc[*Edit Data Binding*] dialog.

[#AutomaticWizard]
== Automatic Data Binding Wizard

The xref:../../../wizards/swing/automatic_databinding.adoc[*Swing Automatic Data Binding*] wizard can be used to create
new user interface classes (Composites, Dialogs or Windows) complete with widgets, layouts and data bindings from
arbitrary domain model (bean) classes.

[#IconDecorator]
== Icon Decorator

Any widget with a data binding assigned to will show up in the component tree with an icon decorator:

[#Source]
== Source

*The tool* will generate or update any necessary data binding code which may then be seen in the *Source* view. An
*initDataBindings()* method is created, if it does not already exist and a call to that method is added to the end of
the widget creation process.

Within the *initDataBindings()* method, any needed bean properties are created followed by the creation of each binding.

WARNING: _do not edit the *initDataBinding()* method by hand (without carefully matching the code generation pattern
used by the tool) as it will be regenerated in its entirety any time the tool needs to add, remove or update a data
binding._
