= Edit Data Binding Dialog

The tool provides two ways to quickly edit existing Data Bindings: the *Data Bindings* menu and the *bindings property*
in the property pane.

| Data Binding Menu
| Bindings Property
a|
The *Data Bindings* menu provides the ability to quickly edit a data binding for a widget. If the widget has existing
data bindings, those are shown at the top of the cascaded menu and a list of widget properties is shown in a submenu.
Clicking on a bound property will open the *Edit Data Binding* dialog.

The *bindings property* in the property pane opens up to show a list of all bindable properties of the widget. Clicking
the image:images/dot-dot-dot-button.gif[image] button next to a bound property will open the *Edit Data Binding* dialog.

The *Edit Data Binding* dialog is used to customize the properties of the data binding itself. When editing a binding,
the update strategy from *target to model* and *model to target* may be specified as well as any strategy-specific
properties (validators and converters).

When the Target or Model is a Text widget and the text property is selected, the triggering event may be specified as
*Swing.Modify*, *Swing.FocusOut* or *Swing.NONE*.

When binding to a *<EL Expression>*, a text field is provided where the expression may be entered.

== Source

Clicking the *Finish* button will generate the necessary data binding code which may then be seen in the *Source* view.
An *initDataBindings()* method is created, if it does not already exist and a call the that method is added to the end
of the widget creation process. Within the *initDataBindings()* method, any needed bean properties are created followed
by the creation of each binding.

WARNING: _do not edit the *initDataBinding()* method by hand (without carefully matching the code generation pattern
used by the tool) as it will be regenerated in its entirety any time the tool needs to add, remove or update a data
binding._
