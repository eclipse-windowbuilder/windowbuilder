= Swing Code Generation

*Swing Designer* supports a wide variety of code generation styles and can emulate most other Java GUI builders
including NetBeans, JBuilder, the Eclipse Visual Editor, etc. Choose a xref:#Variable[*Variable Generation*] style
(xref:#Local[*Local*], xref:#Field[*Field*], xref:#InitializedField[*Initialized Field*] or xref:#Lazy[*Lazy*]) and a
xref:#Statement[*Statement Generation*] style (xref:#Flat[*Flat*] or xref:#Block[*Block*]). Many of the styles have
additional options that can be set. Once any combination of settings is selected, you can see a preview of that code
generation style in the *Preview* pane.

You can also specify in which method components will be created by default (in the event that a suitable method has not
already be defined for the current class). If the method does not exist, it will be created and a call to it added to
the constructor for the class. Various default choices are provided to match the code generation patterns of other GUI
builders.

[#Variable]
== Variable generation

*Swing Designer* supports several *Variable Generation* styles including xref:#Local[*Local*], xref:#Field[*Field*],
xref:#InitializedField[*Initialized Field*] or xref:#Lazy[*Lazy*].

==== [#Local]#Local# Variable Mode

[#Local]
== Local Variable Mode

image:images/code_generation_local.gif[image]

In the *Local* variable generation style, each component is assigned to a unique local variable and initialized at the
point of declaration. An option is provided to declare each variable as *final*. Note that component types marked as
*As Field* on the xref:../preferences/swing/preferences_variables.adoc#TypeSpecific[*Variables > Type Specific*]
preference page will always be assigned to fields.

[#Field]
== Field Mode

In the *Field* generation style, each component is assigned to a unique field and initialized at the point where it is
first used. An option is provided to prefix each field reference with *this*.

== Initialized Field Mode

In the *Initialized Field* generation style, each component is assigned to a unique field and initialized at the point
at the point of declaration. An option is provided to prefix each field reference with *this*.

[#Lazy]
== Lazy Mode

image:images/code_generation_lazy.gif[image]

In the *Lazy* generation style, each component is created in its own unique *getXXX()* method. An option is provided to
set the visibility modifier to *private*, *package private*, *protected* or *public*.

[#Statement]
== Statement generation

*Swing Designer* supports *flat* mode and *block* mode generation modes.

[#Flat]
*Flat Mode*

In *flat* mode, each component is created in the same scope at the same indentation level. An option is provided to
prefix the creation of each component with either a blank line or a comment.

[#Block]
*Block Mode*

image:../preferences/swing/images/code_generation_block.gif[image]

In *block* mode, each component is created in its own scoped code block. Child components are created in nested blocks.
