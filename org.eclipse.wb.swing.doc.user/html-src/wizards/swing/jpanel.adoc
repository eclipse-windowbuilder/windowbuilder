= Swing JPanel Wizard

image:images/wizard_swing_jpanel0.gif[image]

Subclasses of the Swing JPanel class can be created using the Swing JPanel wizard. The wizard can be selected from the
drop down wizard menu or from the Eclipse New wizard.

To use the wizard, select the project source folder and package to contain the class. Then enter the class name and hit
the Finish button. 

The *javax.swing.JPanel* class is the default superclass. You can select an alternative superclass by entering its name
into the *Superclass* field or by choosing it via the bottom *Browse* button.

The wizard generates the following code:

[source,java]
----
import javax.swing.JPanel;

public class SwingJPanelTest extends JPanel {
    public SwingJPanelTest() {
    }
}
----

When editing Swing JPanels, all of the standard Swing layouts, containers, widgets and menus are available. Custom or
third party controls may be added via the *Choose  Component* command. You may also preview your panel using different
look and feels using the drop down look and feel list in the toolbar.

Use the *Expose property...* command added to the *property pane context menu* to expose any widget property as a public
property of the class. Use the *Expose component...*  command added to the popup menu in the *Design View* to add an 
accessor for any widget.
