Subclasses of the Swing *JApplet* class can be created using the *Swing JApplet* wizard. The wizard can be selected from
the drop down wizard menu or from the Eclipse *New* wizard. To use the wizard, select the project source folder and
package to contain the class. Then enter the class name and hit the *Finish* button.

The wizard generates the following code:

[source,java]
----
import javax.swing.JApplet;

public class SwingJAppletTest extends JApplet {
    public SwingJAppletTest() {
    }
}
----

When editing Swing JApplets, all of the standard Swing layouts, containers, widgets and menus are available. Custom or
third party controls may be added via the *Choose Component* command. You may also preview your applet using different
look and feels using the drop down look and feel list in the toolbar.
